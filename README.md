# Wine Quality Prediction ML
 Predicting liquid quality using SVM (Support Vector Machines) and Deep Neural Network.
 
 This model will seek a linear correlation between liquid (in this case: wine) quality and it's ingredients.

There are 6 different quality types: 3,4,5,6,7,8. 3 is the lowest quality and 8 is the highest.
In this model, used 8 features (ingredients of the liquid such as density, alcohol percentage etc.)

Used both SVM Regression and Classification methods. 
In NN, used "linear" as the final activation function, "relu" for the rest.
